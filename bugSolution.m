The primary issue is that the `myString` property is retained, but not checked for `nil` before releasing in `dealloc`.  If `myString` is already `nil` (e.g., if it wasn't set or was previously released), sending `release` to it will cause a crash.  Further, if you don't use ARC, you may also encounter scenarios where a double release occurs if the property is accidentally retained multiple times.  

Here's the corrected code:

**Using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting):**  The simplest solution if your project uses ARC is to change the property declaration:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString; // Use strong instead of retain
```

ARC handles the memory management automatically, eliminating the need for manual `retain`, `release`, and `dealloc` methods. 

**Without ARC (Manual Memory Management):**  If you're not using ARC, you need to add a nil check:

```objectivec
- (void)dealloc {
    if (myString) {
        [myString release];
        myString = nil; // Added this line to set the pointer to nil after releasing.
    }
    [super dealloc];
}
```
This ensures that `release` is only called if `myString` actually holds a valid object.  Additionally, setting `myString` to `nil` afterwards is a good practice to prevent accidental double releases.
